# Todo items


### deployment related issues

* choose where to host the code

## post launch

* Create a table print out for converting from compass to magnetic (avoids having to do second round corrections). Label current table as Magnetic to Compass. Perhaps do with both magnetic on left axis and compass on right axis and the compass one is adjusted so that the curve remains the same.

* Should lock the deviation table after paying for the rose.

* Create a page with different ways to swing a ship. Compass on beach, compass away from interference, sun dial, filming compass when spinning, building your own pelorus, transits, gps bearing output, gps beasing to waypoint.

* Create a tool that for a given location determines what the variation probably is (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geomag/).

* Link to apps that can tell you the local variation (CrowdMag on iOS and Android)

* Set up automated email to people who've created tables prompting them to buy roses. Do it about one week after they create the rose.

* Delete a curve (perhaps not paid curves though?). Have a trash system that empties 30 days after deletion so that undos are possible.

* Compress the number of readings shown - provide another page just with the readings on.

* Let people email in photos of their deviation tables and we'll enter them in and create an account for them.

* store date that the deviations were collected on (can be free form text).

* breadcrumbs?

* require at least 3 readings before moving off reading edit page

* change rose so that the ticks are staggered away from the join - possibly have several rose designs that people can choose from

* Allow some tables to be marked as public (and give them a memorable slug)

* Change rows on deviation entry table to highlight when an input has focus


## maybe someday

* switch text rendering to be pango based (http://cairographics.org/pycairo_pango/)

* Make niceties of login work - eg pass the email address across from login to create account or forgot password.
