# Todo items

## launch

* Compress the number of readings shown - provide another page just with the readings on.

* Show curve name, notes and dates more clearly

* Allow user to edit curve details - vessel, notes etc

* Improve flow from home page to create a new curve.

* store date that the deviations were collected on (can be free form text).

* add text on the table

* add text on the rose

* Safari issue - autofocussed input is the last deviation

* generate several roses into one pdf

* Set up payments for producing high quality tables and roses. Should lock the table.

* Let people email in photos of their deviation tables and we'll enter them in and create an account for them.

* 404 and other error pages

### deployment related issues

* configure email sending

* extract some things into a local_settings.py


## post launch

* breadcrumbs?

* require at least 3 readings before moving off reading edit page

* allow users to delete curves

* change rose so that the ticks are staggered away from the join - possibly have several rose designs that people can choose from

* Allow some tables to be marked as public (and give them a memorable slug)

* Change rows on deviation entry table to highlight when an input has focus

## maybe someday

* create a mailchimp list for people to subscribe to

* switch text rendering to be pango based (http://cairographics.org/pycairo_pango/)

* Make niceties of login work - eg pass the email address across from login to create account or forgot password.
