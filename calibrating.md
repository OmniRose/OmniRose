Deviations

## Some basic background

The ideal compass points perfectly north at all times. Real world compasses do not however - they will be off by a few degrees due to the pull on the compass from onboard magnetic materials - such as the engine, other navigation equipment, perhaps even the phone in your pocket.

Luckily the pull from onboard sources can be measured and recorded so that you can easily tell what correction to apply to the bearing you're reading off or trying to steer to.

Some constant is required to do this and usually it takes the form of a landmark that is at a known bearing. The boat is lined up, a bearing taken to the mark (usually done with an instrument called a pelorus), the boat's heading calculated and the compass reading recorded. Comparing the known heading to the compass reading allows you to calculate the deviation at this point. The boat then needs to be turned to a new bearing and the process repeated.

Instead of using a distant landmark the shadow cast by the sun can also be used, with the angle of the sun at that time and location calculated. There are phone apps that make this trivial. The boat still needs to be spun and readings taken. One advantage to this approach is that the compass and a specially printed and set up sun



Issues

compass lagging true reading as it is being dragged around. If the rotation is slow enough then this should not be an issue. If it is then marking the reference bearing whilst spinning might be able to counter act it.
